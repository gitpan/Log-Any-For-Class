DESCRIPTION
    This module has Rinci metadata.

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  add_logging_to_class(%args) -> any
    Add logging to class.

    Logging will be done using Log::Any.

    Currently this function adds logging around method calls, e.g.:

        -> Class::method(...)
        <- Class::method() = RESULT
        ...

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   classes* => *array*

        Classes to add logging to.

    *   filter_methods => *array*

        Filter methods to add logging to.

        The default is to add logging to all non-private methods. Private
        methods are those prefixed by "_".

    *   logger_args => *any*

        Pass arguments to logger.

        This allows passing arguments to logger routine (see "logger_args").

    *   postcall_logger => *code*

        Supply custom postcall logger.

        Just like precall*logger, but code will be called after method is
        call. Code will be given a hashref argument \%args containing these
        keys: "args" (arrayref, the original @*), "orig" (coderef, the
        original method), "name" (string, the fully-qualified method name),
        "result" (arrayref, the method result), "logger_args" (arguments
        given when adding logging).

        You can use this mechanism to customize logging.

    *   precall_logger => *code*

        Supply custom precall logger.

        Code will be called when logging method call. Code will be given a
        hashref argument \%args containing these keys: "args" (arrayref, the
        original @_), "orig" (coderef, the original method), "name" (string,
        the fully-qualified method name), "logger_args" (arguments given
        when adding logging).

        You can use this mechanism to customize logging.

        The default logger accepts this arguments (in "logger_args"):

        *   indent => INT (default: 0)

        Indent according to nesting level.

        *   max_depth => INT (default: -1)

        Only log to this nesting level. -1 means unlimited.

    Return value:
